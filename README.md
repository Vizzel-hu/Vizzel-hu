Hello my name is Vizzel

Im a new developer looking to learn coding languages like html, python, java, and lua. my favorite thing to do in my free time is code things in games like minecraft. Ive recently been learning a coding language in that uses a 
plugin for minecraft servers. Im the maker of not very known greif utils that is a server greifing skript designed to mess with pay to win servers.
